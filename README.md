# DATA STRUCTURES
Data structures and algorithms are very important in programming.There are various types of data structures. We will be implementing stack , queue,linked lists and trees.We will also be learning different algorithms.

**The programs are implemented using C programming language**

The title of the programs and their explantions are given below:

#### STACK
 * stack1.c - Implementation of stack using array

#### SORTING
* bubblesort.c - Implementation of bubblesort algorithm
